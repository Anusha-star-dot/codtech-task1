# CODTECH Intership Task-1
##  **Task: Version Control with Git**

###  **Steps Performed**

1. Initialized Git repository locally.
2. Created 'file.txt' and committed to **master branch**.
3. Created 'feature-branch' and switched to it.
4. Made changes in 'feature-branch' and committed.
5. Switched back to **master branch** and made conflicting changes in 'file.txt'.
6. Merged 'feature-branch' into 'master' to create merge conflict.
7. Resolved merge conflict manually by:
   - Editing 'file.txt' to keep both branch changes.
   - Removing conflict markers ('<<<<<<<', '======', '>>>>>>>').
